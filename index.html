                    <h1>This is my biography</h1>
                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Matias Szylkowski, born in Montevideo, Uruguay in November 1997. I became interested in software development in 2008 when I created my first game with Microsoft Power Point, a labyrinth game controlled with the mouse. After that, I resorted to the Scratch visual programming language to learn how code works and used StencylWorks to develop my first Flash games. Around 2011 I became familiar with Python, and since then I have learned many other languages as well.</p>
                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>Currently I'm studying Computer Science in the Georgia Institute of Technology with expected graduation term fall 2019. GPA: 4.0</p>
                    <p>Graduated from Escuela Integral in December 2015 with an International Baccalaureate degree. Placed #1 in the class ranking out of 73 students.</p>
                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <p>During the past years I have been doing game development in order to improve my coding skills. Alongside, I have introduced in my projects various other fields of programming, such as writing algorithms to solve mathematical problems, design the user interface, and developing artificially intelligent players that compete against humans and mimic their behaviors. Eventually I would like to learn how to work with robots as well instead of coding purely virtual objects.</p>
                    <p>I am also very interested in how people perceive and interact with technology. Being software a central part of today’s interactions, I always try to refine the UI and UX of my projects to please the users and make the app look more polished. Virtual Reality is becoming a new form of interaction with virtual worlds, and allows for much richer experiences than conventional screens, which I also find particularly interesting.</p>
                    <p>Developing Android apps has gained my interest in the past years as I was learning how to do so, and not only do I like reading about new achievements in the software industry, but also technology in general.</p>
